        <p style="color: yellow;">NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens have been a hot topic in the world of digital assets and cryptocurrency in recent years. NFTs are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain, making them verifiable and impossible to counterfeit. They have been used to represent everything from art, music, and even tweets. With the rising popularity of NFTs, many marketplaces have emerged, providing a platform for creators and collectors to trade these digital assets.
